Getting and cleaning data

Components of tidy data 

Tidy data 

For tidy data you should have four things: 

Raw data file 
Tidy data file
Code book with each variable and its values (metadata) 
Method: exact and explicit recipe used to go from step 1 to x 

Raw data has not:

Had software run on it
Had any of the numbers in the dataset manipulated 
Had any data removed 
Had any data summarised 

Tidy data: 

Each variable should be in one col
Each observation of each variable in a different row 
One table for each 'kind' of variable
Multiple tables should have a key column that can join them 

TIPS: 
Include a row at top with file names
Make variable names readable, rather than acronyms 
In general data should be saved in one file per table 

Code book:

Include: 

Info about variables not included in tidy data set
Info about summary choices made 
Info about experimental survey design

Word/text file 
Study design section with thorough description of data collection 

Instruction list: 

Ideally a computer script 

Input = raw data 
Output = tidy, processed data 
No parameters in script 

#Won't be possible to script every step so use comment feature to narrate the gaps 

working directories 

#can set relative by using:
setwd(".../")		#sets wkd as one level up from current 
#as well as the absolute: 
setwd("/Users/jeromeahye/Documents/DataScience")

checking for and creating file directories 
file.exists("directoryname") 		#checks if dir exists 
dir.create("directoryname")			#creates new dir if doesn't exist 

Can use in tandem: 	 
if (!file.exists("data")) {			 
	dir.create("data")
}
#NOTE: need to use inverse logic, if file exists the command to dir.create will be false 
and nothing will happen, if it doesn't exist the input will be true and dir.create will
create new file. 

download.file()			#command used to download files from the internet into R 
parameters(url, destfile, method) 

#Need to find link address for specific exportable files and bring that into R. 

fileurl <- "https://..."
download.file(fileurl, destfile = ".data/datafile.csv", method = "curl") 
list.files("./data") 
dateDownloaded<- date()		

NOTE: for http you can use download.file(), for https on windows might be ok but on mac 
/ linux need to include "method = curl". Important to keep track of the date downloaded 
and beware of bigger files that you don't want to re-download each time your code runs.
