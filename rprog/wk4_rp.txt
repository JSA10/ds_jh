str() 		#RP thinks str is the most useful function in all R 

Alternative / complement to summary and can apply to all objects including functions.

str(str) 

simulation

use probability distributions to generate random numbers and simulate distributions. 

can use almost any type of distribution, there are four functions for each one: 

r 	e.g. 	rnorm		random numbers generated 
d 			dnorm		density function generated 
p			pnorm		probability distribution
q			qnorm		quantile function 

the args vary by the type of distribution e.g. rnorm(n, mean, sd) 

NOTE: computers can simulate random numbers but they are never truly random. 
To reproduce the function set.seed(1) is needed. Where 1 is an arbitrary number
that signifies where the sequence to generate the random numbers started. If this is 
included then the exact same random numbers can be replicated at another time or by 
someone else. 

sample function used to sample randomly from a preexisting data set 
#specified set of (scalar) objects

> set.seed(1)
> sample(1:10, 4)
[1]3 4 5 7
> sample(1:10, replace = TRUE) ## Sample w/replacement
[1]2 9 7 8 2 8 5 9 7 8

Summary
路 Drawing samples from specific probability distributions can be done with r* functions
路 Standard distributions are built in: Normal, Poisson, Binomial, Exponential, Gamma, etc.
路 The sample function can be used to draw random samples from arbitrary vectors
路 Setting the random number generator seed via set.seed is critical for reproducibility
